# Second Milestone Project - Data Centric Design: API - Code Institute
This is my API single page application built as my second milestone project. The main goal for it is to provide the information on current waether conditions and air quality in the specified city. 
## UX
My first goal in the design of the application was to provide users with the detailed information served in a nice and clean way. 
## Features
The application is using three APIs. **Geocoding API** from Google, obtains the coordinates of a city that was input in the search field, which are subsequently passed to **darksky API**, which provides information about weather conditions and **airvisual API**, which provides information on air quality.
The application is divided into three sections:
* Search field
* Weather data information section, which provides information on the weather conditions in the area, such as temperature, wind speed, pressure, humidity etc.
* Air quality information section, which provides information regarding air quality conditions in the area
### Existing features
